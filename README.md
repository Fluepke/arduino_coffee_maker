This video is a show case of the countless possibilities that HPE ArcSight offers to it's customer.
 
In this show case, I demonstrate how you can use an ArcSight ESM to brew coffee with the help of an Arduino. I adapted a generic, completely banal coffee machine into a fully automated coffee maker using ArcSight.
 
That's of course just an example of the flexibility of the solution. The real possibilities are virtually endless.
 
For this setup, I used:
 
- 1x HPE ArcSight ESM 6.9.1
- 1x Arduino Uno R3
- 1x Arduino Ethernet Shield
- 1x Arduino Relay Module
- 1x Generic coffee machine
 
### Time to setup ###
ArcSight content: Less than 10 minutes, including Flex and CounterAct (REALLY!)

Arduino code + physical connections: About an hour
 
To be more fun, this setup implements HTCPCP, an April's Joke HTTP extension proposed back on 1998 with the objective of controlling a coffee pot.
